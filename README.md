Lab 1: Write a code to load image files having multiple extensions (.jpg, .png, .tiff) from a single folder using a loop and apply all operations mentioned in Lab1 part 2 being in a loop of all images.
Lab9: Your task for this lab to read any small video from YouTube directly (by providing link of that video via code) and apply SIFT descriptor on each frame of that video. Each frame may result in different numbers of detected feature points e.g. few frames are rich of information resulting in more number of interest points. Finally save the resultant SIFT descriptors for whole video in a single file (any suitable file like .h5 or CSV which can be later on used).
